# ðŸ§  Article Summarizer App

This is a **simple yet powerful web app** that summarizes long articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
It uses the **Hugging Face API** and the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model to generate short, clear summaries from large chunks of text.

Built using **Streamlit**, it's super easy to use â€” just paste your text and get a smart summary in seconds.
